Miniboss Expansion is a mod that expands the contents of terraria. 


Minibosses:

As for now it focuses on:
- Ice Golem
- Sand Elemental
- Paladin
- Wyvern

All of those minibosses drop their respective trophy and mask.

In expert mode they drop emblems, which are materials for expert miniboss treasure bags.

These treasure bags include an expert exclusive item.


Others:

After beating WoF Merchant (in Expert mode) sells empty bags, which are a material for the expert miniboss treasure bags.

WoF now drops a hint (in Expert mode), telling the player about the treasure bags.

Minibosses have 20% change of dropping a pet. Why is this in others, you ask. Well these pets are very WIP.
